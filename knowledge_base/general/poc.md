## PoC Steps
A proof of concept consists of the following six fundamental steps:
- Define the idea and what it is trying to achieve, including objectives, scope and necessary resources.
- Identify and organize the team involved in the decision-making and production development process as well as any stakeholders.
- Develop and measure the success criteria by creating specific use cases within the scope.
- Test the idea in an operational environment to examine its functionality, including the design, deployment plan and success criteria.
- Perform test cases with both positive and negative scenarios to examine its durability and document the results.
- Gather and evaluate test results with the team and stakeholders to compare outcomes and see if it met the defined success criteria.



# 5 Steps to a Proof of Concept for Successful Software Development

## What is a Proof of Concept?
While proof of concept has several applications in different fields (ranging from marketing to medicine), when it comes to software development, we’re talking about a specific process. This process is designed to determine whether a software idea can be built in the real world, what technologies should be used in development, and whether the software is likely to be adopted by its intended users.
 
## Why Do You Need a Proof of Concept?
Although nearly everyone who comes up with an idea is convinced it will work, creating a proof of concept to test your idea will ensure you arrive at the best version of it and will save you time and money in the process. Another reason to do a proof of concept that you’ll likely need it to persuade other stakeholders that the idea is worth investing in. Whether you’re adding new features onto an existing software or whether you’re building something new completely from scratch, a proof of concept will ensure that you take the fastest, most direct route to success.
 
## Step 1: Prove the Need
It only makes sense to put time and money into building a product if people really need it. Maybe those people are the company’s employees, who need to improve their productivity. Maybe they’re a new market the company isn’t currently serving but could easily reach. Whoever they are, you need to know that your software will meet their needs.
 
Before you begin building the software, you’ll want to be crystal clear on the pain points your target audience is experiencing. You don’t want to guess what these issues are or assume you know without actually talking to a representative sample of people in the group.
 
You don’t have to talk to hundreds of people at this point — just enough that you start hearing the same concerns repeated. As you interview potential users and stakeholders, be sure to ask about the implications of each pain point. You’ll want to learn both the business impact and the personal impact of each one in order to create a prioritized list. Eventually, you’ll see patterns and common threads emerging. You may be surprised at what you don’t hear in these interviews as well. By the end of this step, you’ll have a list of specific needs and goals that the software should solve.
 
## Step 2: Map Pain Points to Solutions and Get Feedback
This step involves brainstorming ways to solve each of the pain points you identified in the first step. There will likely be several ways to solve each issue. After your brainstorm, you’ll evaluate each possible solution to determine how it stacks up in reference to cost, competition, timeline, technology challenges, etc. When this process is completed, you should have a clearer idea of which solutions to include in the final product.
 
Once you have this list of solutions, go back to the users and stakeholders you initially interviewed and learn their reactions and responses to the recommended solutions. Describe how you envision the product working, and ask for their feedback. This input will provide you with valuable insight as you move forward.
 
## Step 3: Prototype Your Solution and Test
Your next step is to create a prototype that wraps your solutions into a rudimentary product that you can use to test with those you interviewed previously. This prototype should have the expected feature set and UI/UX.
 
Once the prototype is built, test it with your interviewees for additional feedback. Record their use of the product to track how intuitive the interface really is, and find out if you overlooked any important functionality.
 
## Step 4: Create a Minimum Viable Product
An MVP is different from a prototype in that it’s a fully-functional solution that you can put out into the world for use. While it will include only the most-important features that are essential for solving the primary pain points you identified, it should function on the user’s side just like the final product.
 
The MVP gives you the ability to test the product beyond your small group of interviewees, to a wider group that’s more representative of your market or audience. It offers an opportunity for more feedback that will tell you if the product in its current iteration resonates with users and stakeholders.
 
## Step 5: Design a Roadmap
From all of the information you’ve gathered in each of the previous steps, create a roadmap that describes what you’ve learned and outlines a recommended step-by-step process for building the product. Think of this roadmap as a set of blueprints for constructing a building. With this roadmap as a guide, everyone will be kept on the same page through product development and will have a clear picture of what the end goal is.



# 6 Steps to Make your Software Proof of Concept a Success
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140828131241-10893657-the-software-proof-of-concept-6-vital-components-for-success/

A Proof of Concept (or POC) project is a common approach used by companies to assess the viability of a software product for solving a particular business need. The product (often referred to as a solution) can be bought from a vendor or built by an in-house development team, with both approaches having pros and cons.

Through managing a presales team, and having led POC engagements myself, I have seen the symptoms and uncovered causes of successful and failed POCs. There are a few commonsensical but often forgotten factors to bear in mind when planning, launching and reviewing POC activities that can help to lay the foundation for success. Six of these are described here.

## 1. Identifying Champions
The emphasis is on the plural. While most companies assign a single sponsor or champion, the team of champions actually includes:
the main champion at the customer (influences or makes the go/no-go decision at POC sign-off)
the functional owner or process specialist at the customer (understands, clarifies and confirms POC scope)
the technical champion at the customer (represents IT, systems or infrastructure teams and validates the integration of new software with current-state or future-state architecture)
the account executive at the software vendor (introduces the right resources at the right times and works to align expectations for the successful adoption of new software)


the lead technical resource at the software vendor (the hands-on technical expert who, ideally, also understands the industry and business processes involved)
Kick-off, review and sign-off meetings should, at least, include this core team. The team should also ensure that the definition of 'proof of concept' and the success criteria are understood by all.

## 2. Defining Success

Having measurable success criteria is ideal. It should also be achievable in the time frame allowed, with the resources available. Some of the first questions to ask include:
Why are we doing this and what are we trying to achieve?
What are we comparing this to?
Are we testing a specific business process?
Do we need to use our own systems and our own data for this?
What happens if we don't deploy a new system for this?
How do we do it today?
What's right or wrong with the way we do it today?
What's the real value we are hoping to achieve?
Who will maintain this when it's live?
You may find that the POC is being requested in order to test the ease of usability of the product, to check compatibility with existing databases or servers, to compare build vs. buy investment, or all of the above. It is likely that a specific department has a business critical issue they hope to solve through the introduction of a new software system. Quite often it is also the most complex issue that gets selected for the POC, which is not always the recommended approach.

If there are multiple stakeholders involved in the qualification process they probably have different items on their success checklists. An important step here is to figure out whom you need to ask and then to gather and compare expectations. Once you have made the rounds, you can work to create a single success criteria checklist. Along the way, make sure you're using a suitable requirement management platform like RequirementONE to document everything.

## 3. Collaborating To Align Expectations
Defining success criteria is important but if either party is misleading the other based on sensitive information, resource availability, milestone dates, budget availability, etc. this can cause bigger headaches and potentially risk the successful delivery of the POC if it is forced to proceed. 

Customer teams I have spoken with have often been under-prepared and had not considered the lead times incurred in getting hardware and software up and running or in waiting for team members to close off other engagements first. Also, teams usually learn more about the capability of new software during the POC so being open to continuous refinement of the design and emphasising the must-haves early on is ideal. This helps to produce a solution based on business requirements but working within any constraints of the product and other resources. Most customers I have spoken with have been appreciative to learn about these typical project management or change management hurdles that pop up along the way.

Being open to discuss expectations up front and then working together to align these expectations over the lifetime of the POC helps to set achievable milestone dates and, more importantly, to effectively manage the scope.


## 4. Starting With 100%
A good friend of mine told me that he gives everyone he meets full marks and starts deducting points each time they do something that jeopardizes their friendship or that shows disrespect for him, his loved ones or his beliefs. If they reach a certain percentage that's it, they're out! (I believe they can earn make-up points too).

Applying a similar approach to a POC could be healthy, as it leaves you open minded and expecting a win-win outcome right from the start. Professional software companies appreciate feedback about their products and work with customers to refine those products through prototyping, beta programs or testing activity. Expecting the win-win outcome should increase the collaborative nature of the relationship beyond the POC too.

Credibility of the individuals and the organisation you are buying from is vital when investing in technology that will support business operations, so take caution when the points start approaching that you're out threshold.

## 5. Clarifying Next Steps At The Beginning
A logical next step for a software vendor is that a sales order is received. For a customer, the intentions may be similar but the procurement process could involve multiple departments and several months of internal justification to raise the budget to support a purchase order. As an alternative, the next steps for a customer could simply be to compare the success of the POC with that of another software vendor awaiting their turn.

Having better clarity on the next steps required by each party increases the trust element of the relationship (or partnership) you are building. It also improves planning and prioritization of key resources at milestone dates and lets the vendor know you are serious about taking things forward. The latter usually makes it easier to get the vendor's best resources involved in your POC.

## 6. Gathering Feedback, Learning and Evolving
The only feedback that adds value is feedback that confirms the strengths of your current approach or leads to improvements in that approach. Quantifiable feedback (for example, success vs. failure rates, user adoption rates or the number of support tickets raised after go-live) are good for defending your corner (or attacking someone else's) in the boardroom. Qualitative feedback - elicited through surveys, interviews and panel discussions - are essential for correcting the many minor issues that occurred along the way.

Concepts from the Stage-Gate model - originally designed for use in new product development initiatives - can be applied to a software POC. In particular, the measuring and reviewing of progress against a predefined set of success criteria at each stage in the process should improve the quality of deliverables. At the least, it would increase your understanding of the health of the project as it progresses. Taking it a step further, applying the lessons learnt from previous POCs would help to fine tune your approach to future ones.

 
You will notice that all 6 components relate to planning - the better you plan, the less risky and more predictable the POC journey becomes.




# PoC vs pilot

## Proof of concept (PoC) 
is a realization of a certain method or idea in order to demonstrate its feasibility, or a demonstration in principle with the aim of verifying that some concept or theory has practical potential. A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete.

## Pilot

The key benefits of the proof of concept in software development are:
- possibility to choose the best technology stack for your software (application or web platform)
- getting a higher probability of investors' interest in the future software product
- simplifying and making it easier testing and validating ideas for the software's functionality
- receiving valuable feedback of a target audience (users) even before building a full-scope system
- onboarding first clients before an official software release

From the omniscient wikipedia.org:

A proof of concept (POC) or a proof of principle is a realization of a certain method or idea to demonstrate its feasibility, or a demonstration in principle, whose purpose is to verify that some concept or theory has the potential of being used. A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete.

A pilot project refers to an initial roll-out of a system into production, targeting a limited scope of the intended final solution. The scope may be limited by the number of users who can access the system, the business processes affected, the business partners involved, or other restrictions as appropriate to the domain. The purpose of a pilot project is to test, often in a production environment.
