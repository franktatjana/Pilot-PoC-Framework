Timeline Overview

- Phase 1 Planning & Kick-off
- Phase 2 PoC Execution
- Phase 3 Wrap-up

# Analysis of opportunity to conduct a pilot project
## Problem to be addressed or improvement desired
* Goal(s) of the pilot project
* Technology to pilot
* Questions to be answered by the execution of the pilot project
* Pilot project description
* Resources needed
* Identified risks and its evaluation
* Cost/benefits analysis
* Pilot project time frame
* Required resources will be provided
* Impact of failure


# Plan the Evaluation of the Pilot Project
## Success criteria
_[Identify the criteria which will allow to declare, at the end of the pilot, that the pilot project was a success]_
* _success criteria 1_
* _success criteria 2_
* _success criteria 3_
* _success criteria 4_

## Variables to be measured
* Self-assessment performed at the beginning of pilot
* Identification of the technology to pilot
* Effort (staff-hours), from the pilot coordinator 
* Effort (staff-hours), from the VSE in pilot preparation and in adoption of the technology to pilot (e.g. pilot planning, * training and support in the technology to pilot)
* Effort (staff-hours), from the VSE in pilot project execution
* Issues related to pilot plan execution
* Self-assessment performed at the end of pilot
* Lessons learned at the end of pilot
* Other variables to be measured


## Threats to validity of pilot results
_[Identify the possible threats to the validity of pilot results]_

## Other variables to control
_[Identify variables to control (in order to isolate the effects being measured to the key independent variables)]_

## Define the mechanism for doing the evaluation of the pilot
_[Define the mechanism, e.g. processes, formats, responsibilities for obtaining the data needed to perform the evaluation]_
*  Stakeholders whose inputs are important to evaluate the pilot
*  Define information required to perform the evaluation
*  Define processes, formats, responsibilities for obtaining the data needed to perform the evaluation

## Procedures for gathering of data needed for pilot evaluation
Issues related to pilot project plan execution are recorded (e.g. changes in scope, schedule, resources, etc. to the pilot project and to the technology adoption)
Self-assessment at the beginning of the pilot
Debriefing at the end of pilot to collect feedback and lessons learned
Procedure for the rest of variables
