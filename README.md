# Pilot (PoC) Framework

## Goals
* document the agreements --> .md files
* track the progress --> milestones
* Q&A --> issues

## Conventions
Individual requirements are documented in **user stories** (the smallest unit of work). 

The common structure for a user story addresses the “who, what, and why” of a feature: “As a *user type*, I want to *task* so that *goal*”

For example: “As a *customer*, I want to *create an account* so that *I can make purchases*”

Requirements belonging to the same context are united as **epic**, which is a "big" user story. Difference: time and complexity.

Issues should be completed in the smallest amount of time possible. If an issue will take weeks or months to finish, it should probably be an Epic.
